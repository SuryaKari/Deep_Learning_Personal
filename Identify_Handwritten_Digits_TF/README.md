### This repository is my attempt to create projects while I learn Tensorflow based image classifiers.   
  
**Project 1 :** [Identify handwritten images using Tensorflow](https://github.com/Suryak1986/Deep-Learning/blob/master/Identify_Handwritten_Digits_TF/Identify_Handwritten_Images_using_Tensorflow.ipynb)
  
***Known Issue :*** The classify.predict(test_data[0]) does not seem to work. This might be resolved if I use conda to install Tensorflow in Anaconda rather than using a docker image. I will test this out and update the code
