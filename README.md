# Deep-Learning

### First Neural Network

This is an implementation of a neural network with hidden units that have sigmoid functions as their output. The ouput does not have sigmoid function because it is a model that is predicting a continuious variable. More details in the Jupyter Notebook. 

The Neural Network has calculations that do both Forward Propagation through to the output node and then do backwards propagation to calculate hidden units errors and adjust weights accordingly.
